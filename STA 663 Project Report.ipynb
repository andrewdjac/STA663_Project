    "In this report we implement a form of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was first introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan in 2003 as a hierarchical modeling approach for discrete data such as text in a corpus. This algorithm hinges on the notion that collections of data, such as text in a document, are generated according to a latent topic distribution, where each topic assigns probabilities to different words. The purpose of LDA in topic modeling is to group documents based on similar topic distributions, and to identify key words in each topic. Using a collapsed Gibbs sampler approach to LDA as described in Darling 2011, we implement an algorithm that estimates the latent topic distributions of a given corpus of documents. In addition, our algorithm returns key words assigned to each topic. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated data and documents from the Newsgroups corpus.\n",

    "The LDA algorithm takes in 4 inputs: a corpus of documents, the number of topics, two optional choices for hyperparameters, and an optional specification on the number iterations for the Gibbs Sampler. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to estimate the topic distribution for each document as well as the word distribution for each topic. It does this by making inference on the latent topics of each word in the given corpus. We perform this inference by implementing a Gibbs sampler. First the algorithm sets a starting point by randomly sampling topics for each of the words in the corpus. Then it iteratively samples new topics for each word using calculated posterior probabilities. After a number of iterations, the Gibbs Sampler returns the estimated topics for each word, which are then used to calculate the latent topic distributions and word distributions using Monte Carlo estimation. These estimated quantities are returned to the user."

    "The algorithm takes as input a corpus of documents represented as a $M$x$V$  bag-of-words matrix. In addition, it takes as input the number of topics $K$. It also takes in two positive values representing the hyperparameters for the topic distribution ($\\alpha$) and the word distribution ($\\beta$). For this implementation we use symmetric priors for the dirichlet distributions, which means only one value is needed as input for each prior. Finally it takes as input the number iterations for the Gibbs sampler."

    "The algorithm for LDA has three main steps. The first step of the algorithm is preparing the data for the Gibbs sampler. As a starting point for our sampler, we first must randomly assign topics $z_{m,n}$ for each of the words in the given corpus. We then create two different count matrices, $N_1$ and $N_2$: $N_1$ is a $M$x$K$ matrix that counts the distribution of topics across documents. $N_2$ is a $K$x$V$ matrix that counts the distribution of words across topics. The count matrices are initialized according to the random topic assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is the implementation of the Gibbs sampler. For each iteration, our sampler loops through every word $w_{m,n}$ in every document of our corpus. For each word, we first remove its assigned topic and decrement the appropriate count matrices $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$. We then calculate the posterior probabilities of the word belonging to each of the possible topics. One of these topics is sampled using these probabilities and is assigned to the word. Finally, all of the count matrices are incremented according to this new topic. This process is done for all the words in the corpus for how many iterations the user specified."
