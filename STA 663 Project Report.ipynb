    "In this report we implement a form of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was first introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan in 2003 as a hierarchical modeling approach for discrete data such as text in a corpus. This algorithm hinges on the notion that collections of data, such as text in a document, are generated according to a latent topic distribution, where each topic assigns probabilities to different words. The purpose of LDA in topic modeling is to group documents based on similar topic distributions, and to identify key words in each topic. Using a collapsed Gibbs sampler approach to LDA as described in Darling 2011, we implement an algorithm that estimates the latent topic distributions of a given corpus of documents. In addition, our algorithm returns key words assigned to each topic. We optimize our algorithm's Gibbs sampler using \"just-in-time\" compilation. We then evaluate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated data and documents from the Newsgroups corpus. Finally, we compare the accuracy of our algorithm to a variational bayes approach to LDA and to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).\n",

    "The LDA algorithm takes in 4 inputs: a corpus of documents, the number of topics, two optional choices for hyperparameters, and an optional specification on the number iterations for the Gibbs Sampler. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to estimate the topic distribution for each document as well as the word distribution for each topic. It does this by making inference on the latent topics of each word in the given corpus. We perform this inference by implementing a Gibbs sampler. First the algorithm sets a starting point by randomly sampling topics for each of the words in the corpus. Then it iteratively samples new topics for each word using calculated posterior probabilities. After a number of iterations, the Gibbs Sampler returns the estimated topics for each word, which are then used to calculate the latent topic distributions and word distributions using Monte Carlo estimation. These estimated quantities are returned to the user."

We then create two different count matrices, $N_1$ and $N_2$: $N_1$ is a $M$x$K$ matrix that counts the distribution of topics across documents. $N_2$ is a $K$x$V$ matrix that counts the distribution of words across topics.

We then calculate the posterior probabilities of the word belonging to each of the possible topics. One of these topics is sampled using these probabilities and is assigned to the word. Finally, all of the count matrices are incremented according to this new topic. This process is done for all the words in the corpus for how many iterations the user specified."
